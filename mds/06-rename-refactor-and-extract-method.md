# Rename Refactor

```js
let colorInput = document.getElementbyId('colorInput')

class App {
  constructor() {
    // ...
    const color = colorInput.valuel
    // ...

    // and again if we use colorInput...
  }
}
```

So we can use `Rename Refactor` which is `F2`. I mean after selecting the word then click `F2` then you will have this below:

It can rename even that is in other files as well...
