## Emmet

I recommend to watch the course to know more about EMMET.

[EMMET FOR HTML & CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/customize-vs-code/emmet-for-html-css/)

and also read: 

[VS Code Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet)

As you can see on the picture below, I set it up, you can say what the hell is going on? There we are setting emmet balance into `Ctrl + up + up` for `inward` and `Ctrl + down + down` for `outward`.

and I clicked `Ctrl + down + down`

If I click `Ctrl + up + up`, it will move back as before...

Just try on your VS Code and then you will understand more clearly.

Happy Coding!!!
